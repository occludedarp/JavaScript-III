* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.

* 3. after this. has been implicitly bound within the context of a class constructor object, the keyword 'new' subsequently binds this. to any newly declared objects derived from the class constructor

* 4. assigning this. to an object of your choosing
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
